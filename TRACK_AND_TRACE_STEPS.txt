Sending:

- config opties:
  oxalis.replyto.endpoint   (url)
  oxalis.replyto.identifier (<schemeid>:<id>)
  oxalis.replyto.sender     (true/false)

- AS2 experimental headers:
  X-Reply-To: <schemeid>:<id>
  X-Reply-To-Endpoint: <URL>

- mark sent document as 'not-replied-yet' (by transactionid?)

Handling Doc with reply-to:
  mark header in meta-info
  if any reply-to set in meta-info (reply-to-endpoint overriders
  reply-to-sender):
    - check if receiver exists
      * send response on error
    - validate document
      * send response on error
    - either send OK immediately (oxalis.reply.automatic=true)
    - or send OK upon action (oxalis.reply.automatic=false)
  last part needs state: document-not-replied yet. So first do auto-reply

Sending Replies:
  - Create MLR with status
  - lookup endpoint if necessary;
    * which endpoint type? new profile?
    *

Receiving replies:
  - lookup original document
    * send mdn error if not found
  - add status to it.


TestTool changes:
  - 'sent-docs' page with status for each sent document
  - 'send-reply' button to incoming documents to mark as received if
    oxalis not set to autorespond (need to track whether is was
    automatically sent too)
